After a prestigious reign of 67 years, the powerful pharaoh dies at the exceptional age of 92. He becomes for all time the legendary “Ramesses the Great.” His mummy is interred in the heart of the Valley of the Kings, on the west bank of Thebes. This marks the beginning of his Great Journey towards the afterlife, where he will meet with eternity. But only on one condition: that his tomb and mummified remains are preserved for all time. In the 19th century several European travelers visit the tomb of the illustrious king. Their aim is to reach the burial chamber that houses his body and all his treasures. Now begins a fascinating archeological investigation through time and space, which reveals the rocambolesque story of the “after-life” of Ramesses the Second.",

It was a monumental victory that should have ensured Scottish freedom – but it didn’t. Even after Bannockburn, Scotland’s king Robert Bruce and his brother Edward remained uneasy about the threat of a renewed English invasion. The best form of defense was attack. In a real-life “Game of Thrones”, they decided to invade Ireland and make Edward high king there. In this way they would unite the Celtic nations and drive the hated English back to their homeland.",

In those decisive hours, when their fates do not belong to them and are in someone else’s hands, where federal immigration inspectors decide who is approved and who is sent home, the Melting Pot was born, built up of the teeming masses arriving from the Old Continent.\nRewriting the story of some exemplary destinies for a few, among the anonymous and long-forgotten voices of the other immigrants, we will relate the greatest European tragedies of the first half of the 20th century to an ambivalent America, which welcomes through successive waves, an immigration who will recreate and embody the American Dream.",

Young British soldiers, many of them budding poets, were led to early and ghastly deaths in muddy wastes by incompetent generals for reasons that were seemingly futile. Although clichés are not necessarily lies, they are at best a selective view of the truth. This is a stunning account of the hostilities which offers new insight into one of the defining events of the twentieth century. For the first time, it offers a truly global vision of a conflict which is often misconceived as a prolonged skirmish on the Western Front. Accessible, compelling and utterly convincing, this is modern history revealed at its finest. ",
