For the first time, a film portrays the wild scientific quest that dark matter gives rise to. A real thriller.\nIn our physical models, the weight of all observable matter (stars, galaxies, etc.) accounts for just 4% of the universe, whereas an invisible, unknown matter that no tool has ever been able to detect appears to populate the universe on a massive scale.\n \nToday, astrophysicists and cosmologists - researchers in the fields of the infinitely large and the infinitely small - are joining forces to solve a major mystery: what is this famous “dark matter” made up of?\n \nA breath-taking thriller that leads us to the dawn of a scientific and metaphysical revolution, akin to Copernic’s or Galileo’s. It could totally change the way we perceive our world.",

That means it will continue to dissipate on into the future through a number of well defined epochs. A large international collaboration called the Galaxy and Mass Assembly Project (GAMA) has been surveying deep regions of the universe to find out how the energy output of galaxies has changed.\n\nThey found that a large sampling are emitting about half the energy they did two billion years ago. This is because rates of star birth are steadily declining. This is part of a slow decline in our current epoch, known as the Stellar Epoch, the epoch of stars. As one astronomer put it, the universe has settled down on the couch, while getting lazier and older. The timeline of this epoch, however, is many trillions of years into the future.",

But they may be the most common type of planet in our galaxy, according to data from the Kepler Space Telescope. Some have rock or ice cores wrapped in hydrogen and helium gas. Others are solid rock covered in water or ice, or flowing lava.\n\nThe planet HD189733b may become a Super Earth. This gas giant orbits its parent star at 1/30th the distance between Earth and the Sun. A flare from the star blasted its atmosphere, sending a plume of gas flying into space at a rate of 1000 tons per second. \n\nGJ 1214b, orbiting a star 40 light years away, has a mass 6 times that of Earth. It is surrounded by an atmosphere of steam or thick haze. \n\nHD 85512b is 3.6 times the mass of Earth. It orbits a sun-like star and lies at the edge of the habitable zone. Liquid water, and perhaps even life, could exist on its surface. Gliese 667 is a triple star system. The fainter of the three, 667C, has been found to host three Super Earths, all within the life zones of their parent star. 667Cc is 4 times the mass of Earth. But it’s so close that it’s likely exposed to deadly flares, x-ray and ultraviolet radiation. \n\nKepler 10 is a Sun-like star 564 light years from Earth. Kepler 10b is a rocky planet more than three times the mass of Earth. It’s so close to its star that its orbit lasts only 19 hours. With a density similar to iron, its surface is molten.\n\nKepler 62 is a star 1200 light years away. Slightly smaller and cooler than our Sun. Of five known planets around this star, Kepler 62e orbits the inner edge of the habitable zone. At 1.6 times the mass of Earth, 62e is probably solid. It could be terrestrial or water-ice dominated. Kepler 62f lies within the habitable zone. At 2.8 times the mass of Earth, it is probably rocky and covered by ocean or ice.",

A new image from ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, reveals extraordinarily fine detail that has never been seen before in the planet-forming disc around a young star. These are the first observations that have used ALMA in its near-final configuration and the sharpest pictures ever made at submillimetre wavelengths. The new results are an enormous step forward in the observation of how protoplanetary discs develop and how planets form.\n\nFor ALMA’s first observations in its new and most powerful mode, researchers pointed the antennas at HL Tauri — a young star, about 450 light-years away, which is surrounded by a dusty disc. The resulting image exceeds all expectations and reveals unexpectedly fine detail in the disc of material left over from star birth. It shows a series of concentric bright rings, separated by gaps.",

The American astronomer Percival Lowell saw in these canals the future of Earth. Here was a dying civilization trying to rescue itself from a global ecological crisis. \nBut our leaps of the imagination are not limited to Mars… as we scour the galaxy for sun-like stars, with solar systems, and earth-like planets.

While previous Mars orbiters have peered down at the planet’s surface, MAVEN is spending part of its time gazing at the stars, looking for subtle changes in their color as they dip through the limb of Mars and set below the horizon. Such stellar occultations reveal what the atmosphere is made of, and how its composition varies with altitude. MAVEN’s observations are providing the most detailed picture of the Mars upper atmosphere to date, helping scientists understand how Mars turned from a warm and wet planet in its youth, into the forbidding desert that we see today.",

But now he's turning his attention to the world of nature. Can quantum mechanics explain the greatest mysteries in biology?\n\nHis first encounter is with the robin. This familiar little bird turns out to navigate using one of the most bizarre effects in physics - quantum entanglement, a process which seems to defy common sense. Even Albert Einstein himself could not believe it.\n\nJim finds that even the most personal of human experiences - our sense of smell - is touched by ethereal quantum vibrations. According to the latest experiments, it seems that our quantum noses are listening to smells. Jim then discovers that the most famous law of quantum physics - the uncertainty principle - is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis.\n\nFinally, Jim asks if quantum physics might play a role in evolution. Could the strange laws of the sub-atomic world, which allow objects to tunnel through impassable barriers in defiance of common sense, effect the mechanism by which living species evolve?",

With the recent launch of the first privately owned space craft to service the international space station; it’s time to take a fresh look at the new frontiers of space. What does the immediate future hold? A return to the Moon, manned flights to Mars or Titan, mining the asteroid belt or finding an earth-like planet in the cosmos, these goals could be achieved in decades to come. The explosion of private investment including tourist flights from Virgin Galactic and The Red Bull Stratos have all combined to reshape our goals. Europe and the ESA have shouldered their burden of exploration and now Japan, China and India have all committed to launching probes to the Moon, Mars and beyond! The New Frontier will explore our most exploration and the potential endeavors which lie ahead. ",

            "uniqueDescription": "Due to world events over the last twenty years and the decline in government finance; Space exploration has fallen from the media’s gaze into the shadows. With the recent launch of the first privately owned space craft to service the international space station; it’s time to take a fresh look at the new frontiers of space. What does the immediate future hold? A return to the Moon, manned flights to Mars or Titan, mining the asteroid belt or finding an earth-like planet in the cosmos, these goals could be achieved in decades to come. The explosion of private investment including tourist flights from Virgin Galactic and The Red Bull Stratos have all combined to reshape our goals. Europe and the ESA have shouldered their burden of exploration and now Japan, China and India have all committed to launching probes to the Moon, Mars and beyond! The New Frontier will explore our most exploration and the potential endeavors which lie ahead. ",
